                Waifu2x is a super-resolution imaging software that utilizes deep convolutional neural networks. It is a
                considerable popular open-source software on github with around 19.6k star on github!
                It is so popular that there have been many popular 3rd party software/project based off Waifu2x. Of
                those 3rd party softwares, include Waifu2x-Caffe, Waifu2x-NCNN-Vulkan, Waifu2x-Converter-CPP, and
                Video2x are the more popular ones.
                Waifu2x has a demo application that can be found on their <a href="http://waifu2x.udp.jp/">website</a>
                and a downloadable one from their <a href="https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x">github</a> repository.
                Waifu2x is currently only compatible on Linux machines and the last big release was from Novemember 18,
                2018.
                Fret not as those 3rd party softwares perform just as well if not better! We'll be exploring the basic
                features that Waifu2x provide by looking at Waifu2x's demo application on their website.

                <p class="introduction_intro">
                    Waifu2x is a popular open source software that makes use of super resolution to improve 2D image
                    quality.
                    Not only does this software provide image <a
                        href="https://www.howtogeek.com/427091/what-is-upscaling-on-a-tv/#:~:text=Upscaling%20Reduces%20Optical%20Resolution&text=The%20most%20basic%20is%20called,at%20its%20four%20neighboring%20pixels.">upscaling</a>,
                    but also provides noise reduction/removal. Unlike traditional upscalers,
                    Waifu2x's upscaler not only increases an image's resolution, but by utilizing deep convolutional
                    neural networks, its able to with suprising accuracy, correctly predict missing pixels.
                    <!-- https://www.howtogeek.com/427091/what-is-upscaling-on-a-tv/#:~:text=Upscaling%20Reduces%20Optical%20Resolution&text=The%20most%20basic%20is%20called,at%20its%20four%20neighboring%20pixels.  -->
                    An example of Waifu2x in action can be seen in the image below which can also be found on Waifu2x's
                    github repository.
                    The first section shows how good Waifu2x's 2x upscale of the small image look compared to GIMP's
                    lanczos3 algorithm.
                    The next section shows how Waifu2x performs against GIMP's selective blur when working with a noisy
                    image, and in this case, with <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_artifact">compression artifacts</a>.
                    GIMP's selective blur didn't do too bad, but Waifu2x's noise reduction is simply at another level!
                    This image doesn't show the original image before being compressed, resulting in these artifacts,
                    but based on the previous image we can assume that Waifu2x did a pretty solid job. In the final
                    section we have a small noisy image that's being upscaled and denoised all at once. Again you can
                    see how well
                    Waifu2x did, but you can truly see how great the combination of upscaling and denoising if you
                    compare the final result here to the initial 2x upscaling result.
                    By denoising the image, althought it removed a lot of the noise, the denoising function
                    unexpected(or expectectly) performed it across the entire image and caused blurring by smoothing out
                    a lot of things.
                    Most aren't noticable, but the most noticable would be how the black strokes/lines are a lot
                    smoother or "sharper" compared to just upscaling the image(which can be seen in the first image
                    result).
                    So despite how great Waifu2x is at improving an image quality, its not the holy grail. We will be
                    exploring more examples of Waifu2x compared to other softwares and more information pertaining to
                    its upscaling and denoising feature.
