                Waifu2x-caffe is a 3rd-party software built for Window machines that utilizes an NVIDIA GPU and is based
                off of Waifu2x. For those wondering what Caffe in Waifu2x-caffe means, <a class="reference"
                    href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-au/data-center/gpu-accelerated-applications/caffe/"

                the
                deep learning framework and so Waifu2x-caffe is just the Caffe version of the original Waifu2x software.
                What sets Waifu2x-caffe from other 3rd-party softwares is that it utilizes <a class="reference"

                processing speeds

                <p>
                    Waifu2x-Caffe can support a single input, whether it's just one image or an entire folder with
                    multiple images. It supports various file extensions as seen in the image, but it does not support
                    video files. Despite how video files are just made up of a whole lot of images, Waifu2x-Caffe
                    does not support video files, though Video2x, 3rd-party software does support video files which
                    we'll talk about later. If you really want to use Waifu2x-Caffe on videos, then I suggest finding
                    someway to extract all image frames from the video into one folder. There are many ways to extract
                    image
                    frames from a video, but the best way would be through using <a class="reference"
                        href="https://ffmpeg.org/" title="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a>.
                    FFmpeg is a very powerful open source software that can handle/process videos, audios, and other
                    multimedia files. It is an extremely powerful and useful tool to learn and use, though the downside
                    would be that it can be quite difficult to learn at first.

                <h2>Conversion Image Quality & Processing Settings</h2>
                <p>
                    The conversion mode allows users to choose whether they want to upscale the image, denoise the
                    image, or both.
                    The most important thing to note here is the denoise level. Denoising should only be used when there
                    is noise or compression involved.
                    Level 0 denoise should be used when the image has only gone through one compression, while level 1
                    is for those images that have gone through
                    a couple compressions, level 2 for those that have gone through many compressions such as those
                    memes that keep getting reposted resulting in a degraded
                    and god-awful image quality, and level 3 should only be used to get rid of compression artifacts.
                    Denoising can result in smoother lines or even losing the small details, so it's important to ensure
                    you choose the best denoising levels for your needs. When in doubt just test each option and compare
                    your results.

                        Test time augmentation(TTA) is a way of testing datasets by flipping it multiple times and
                        getting
                        the average for a more accurate prediction.

                        TTA mode in Waifu2x basically involves flipping
                        the image 8 times, then upscale it and finally average all 8 images in order to have an even
                        higher quality upscaled image. TTA mode can also remove serveral times of artfiacts, stated by

                        Split size and batch size are for managing the amount of images in batches that Waifu2x-caffe
                        will process at once. So the bigger the split and batch size the faster the upscaling processes
                        will take.
                        The problem with having a bigger split and batch size is the amount of memory it'll use. If the
                        processor is set to CUDA, then it'll be important to consider VRAM as this setting will use a
                        lot of it.
                        <br>
                        Lastly there are the general settings, check cuDNN, and UI language setting. The UI language
                        setting has 12 selectable languages. The app settings allows various miscellaneous settings and
                        the most important being able to choose either CPU or CUDA processor. The check cuDNN setting
                        allows the users to verify if the CUDA processor can be used.
